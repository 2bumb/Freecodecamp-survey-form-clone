This repository, inspired by FreeCodeCamp's survey form project, aims to enhance my fundamental skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript by creating a survey form, simultaneously providing assistance to others navigating the same learning path.
As I delve into web development, I appreciate any constructive feedback from all to help refine my skills and  overall growth as a whole.
